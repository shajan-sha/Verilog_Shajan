In this all program these are the simple program for Half adder, Binary to grey code converter and Grey to binary converter

Half adder:
***********
           which takes two input and produces 2 output
           a and b is the input 
           s and c is the output
           
       
Binary to Grey code converter:
******************************
                            which is 4 bit Binary to grey code converter
                            inputs are b3, b2, b1, b0
                            outputs are g3, g2, g1, g0
                       
Grey to binary code converter:
******************************
                              which is 4 bit Grey to binary converter 
                              inputs are g3, g2, g1, g0
                              outputs are b3, b2, b1, b0
